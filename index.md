#### About

My name is Adrian L Lange, welcome to my humble home on the internet.

I have a bachelor's degree in [IT-Operations and Information Security](//ntnu.edu/studies/bitsec) from [NTNU](//ntnu.edu), and I currently work at [HelseCERT](//nhn.no/helsecert) in Trondheim, Norway.

Most of my public work is found on [GitHub](//github.com/p3lim), and sometimes I also [write](/archive).
