#### About

My name is Adrian L Lange, and this is my humble home on the internet.

I'm currently studying Information Security at [NTNU](//ntnu.edu/studies/bitsec), and I'm most commonly known for [creating add-ons](//github.com/p3lim-wow) for World of Warcraft.

Most of my work is found on [GitHub](//github.com/p3lim), but sometimes I [write](/archive).
