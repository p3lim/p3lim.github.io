title: Welcome Jekyll

So, I've decided to finally join the rest of the internet and make a blog.
<!--more-->
The main reason for making this is to exercise my abilities to create anything front-end, as I tend to stay in the shadows building things that stay in the back, and thus my designing skills are completely non-existent.

Another reason is would be to exercise my writing. English is not my native language (although preferred), and writing about whatever I feel like would shine some improvement onto my abilities to express myself (or anything for that matter).

I will probably post about anything technology-related that interests me, like programming, hardware or even games, who knows, but for the time being, I will continue working on this little platform of mine.

I will probably post some more in the next few days or weeks about things I am currently working on/with, like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (this website), and I will most likely do a writeup on the keyboard I recently built!

We'll see.
